# This workflow will build a Java project with Gradle and cache/restore any dependencies to improve the workflow execution time
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-java-with-gradle
# It also setups Python to run the TextTest suite
# Finally, the workflow also runs JUnit tests and uploads the build reports as artifacts
